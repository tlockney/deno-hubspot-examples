# Deno HubSpot SDK example

This repo is just a simple playground for testing out our HubSpot APIs/SDKs
using Deno. In particular, for it's Jupyter support, though I'll likely try to
maintain raw scripts alongside the notebooks (see `convert.sh`).

To run these scripts successfully, create a `.env` file with your access token
like this:

```
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN='<INSERT TOKEN HERE>'
```
